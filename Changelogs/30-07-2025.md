# Changelogs – 30/07/2025
- Added a **"Reset All Filters"** button.
- Added a credits section in the website footer acknowledging all developers and contributors.
- Implemented currency conversion functionality using live market data retrieved via an API.
- Updated the Specialties and Sub-specialties dropdowns to dynamically retrieve their values from the certification tags embedded in the code. This ensures that any new tags added to a certification (e.g., under “HR Recognised”) will automatically appear as filter options in the corresponding dropdown.
  - Example: If a certification includes the tag HR Recognised: Blabla, the value "Blabla" will be added to the HR Recognised dropdown filter as an option without manual intervention.
- Added a new filter for Exam Type, allowing users to filter certifications by Hands-On or Multiple Choice (MCQ) formats. (New Exam Type options can be added dynamically, following the same tag-based system previously implemented.)
- Consolidated all filters under a single expandable button. Clicking the button reveals all available filters with a smooth transition animation for improved user experience.
- Implemented a page-wide loading animation that triggers on initial load.

- Fixed an issue where **case-sensitive URLs** caused link failures.

- Resolved a visual glitch in the borders of the top-left and top-right column titles.
